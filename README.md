# HotPlate

# Description

The idea behind this project is to provide a platform for an industry that has gone underappreciated. Personal chefs and those who specialize in catering often have to rely on word of mouth or individual websites to obtain business. HotPlate is an idea for clients to search for chefs and catering specialists based on ratings and previous experience. 

# User Story

 I hope to provide chefs with the power to manage events or client requests through a central site and be able to interact with clients through this portal. The diagram below is the foundation of how the relationship between clients and chefs will be managed. An initial wireframe of the home page will also be provided to demonstrate how clients can search for chefs.

# Diagram

The following diagram displays how I anticipate the model relationships to interact with each other. The primary focus is around the user models which during initial phases did create some walls with being able to progress with this project quickly. The calendar feature is something that I would definitely love to expand on to provide a central control for any and all requests that a chef might receive.

# Wireframe

This is a simple wireframe of the home page and how ideally I would like to route from this homepage into the other main parts of the site.

# The Struggles and the Works

Thankfully, Django makes user and user creation very easy to control with their embedded user model; however, this did not take away that it was very much a struggle to manipulate this model to work a little more dynamically. 

Going forward, as mentioned above one of the primary features I would like to implement is a built-in calendar for our chefs to manage their events. The second feature that would be most useful in my opinion would be a direct messaging feature to allow better communication channels between users.
