# HotPlate

The idea behind this project is to provide a platform for an industry that has gone underappreciated. Personal chefs and those who specialize in catering often have to rely on word of mouth or individual websites to obtain business. HotPlate is an idea for clients to search for chefs and catering specialists based on ratings and previous experience. 

The idea is to provide chefs with the power to manage events or client requests through a central calendar and be able to interact with clients through this portal. The diagram below is the foundation of how the relationship between clients and chefs will be managed. An initial wireframe of the home page will also be provided to demonstrate how clients can search for chefs.
